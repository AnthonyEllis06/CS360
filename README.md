Q: Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

A: The requirements of the app were to show a grid table that diplayed data pulled from a user defined database. This app is intended to help the user track their weight and health.

Q: What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

A: The ui allows users to input a weight that is then placed on a grid to show the logged weight. I tried to keep users in mind by recognizing things such as the input blocking the text field to allow them a more smooth and enjoyable experience.

Q: How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those techniques or strategies be applied in the future?

A: I mostly tried to follow the instructions laid out by the class however I would have preffered to build the back end first before designing the UI.

Q: How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important, and what did it reveal?

A: I tested to see if the implemented parts were functional by manually using the emulator and testing the app.

Q: Consider the full app design and development process from initial planning to finalization. Where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

A: I had to innovate and overcome multiple times and that is part of the reason I did not finish. I had to scrap my first UI design because I had to redesign with components and relative layout in mind. 

Q: In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

A: I was successful in implenting a grid table that pulled information from the user database.
